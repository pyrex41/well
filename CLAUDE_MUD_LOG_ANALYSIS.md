## Petrophysical Observations

### Porosity Development
1. **Primary Porosity:** Best developed in Aux Vases sandstone (loose, well-sorted quartz grains)
2. **Secondary Porosity:** Oolitic and vugular porosity in St. Genevieve limestone
3. **Fractured Porosity:** Limited evidence in deeper carbonates

### Permeability Indicators
- **Aux Vases:** Excellent permeability indicated by loose sand grains and oil shows
- **St. Genevieve:** Moderate permeability through oolitic/intergranular network
- **Deeper Zones:** Limited permeability due to tight micritic texture

## Drilling Parameters Analysis

- **Middle Section (400-700'):** 6K-10K lbs  
- **Deep Section (700-900'):** 7.5K-12K lbs
- **Trend:** Increasing WOB with depth indicates formation hardness increase

### Rate of Penetration (ROP)
- **Fast Drilling:** Coal and shale intervals
- **Slow Drilling:** Tight limestone and cemented sandstone intervals
- **Optimal ROP:** Aux Vases sandstone showed good drilling characteristics

## Completion Recommendations

### Primary Target: Aux Vases Sandstone (760-780')
- **Pros:** Excellent porosity, good oil shows, loose sand indicates high permeability
- **Completion:** Conventional completion with sand control
- **Expected Production:** Moderate to good oil production rates

### Secondary Target: St. Genevieve Limestone (780-800')
- **Pros:** Oolitic porosity, oil in cavities, established production in area
- **Completion:** Acid stimulation recommended
- **Expected Production:** Lower rate but potentially longer-lived

### Deep Ordovician Target: Trenton/Galena Carbonates (2850-3020')
- **Pros:** Multiple oil shows, microfractured limestone, good reservoir quality
- **Completion:** Hydraulic fracturing recommended to enhance microfracture network
- **Expected Production:** Potentially significant reserves, requires stimulation
- **Risk:** Deep completion costs, formation evaluation needed

### Devonian Target: Sweetland Creek/Chouteau (1793-2049')
- **Pros:** Multiple hydrocarbon shows including gas, established production interval regionally
- **Completion:** Horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing for shale gas potential
- **Expected Production:** Gas and oil potential, unconventional completion required

### Shallow Target: Kickapoo Sandstone (200-250')
- **Pros:** Shallow depth, oil shows present
- **Cons:** High clay content, tight cementation
- **Completion:** Marginal economic viability

## Geological Interpretation

### Depositional Environment
- **Aux Vases:** High-energy marine/fluvial environment producing clean, well-sorted sandstone
- **St. Genevieve:** Shallow marine carbonate shelf with oolitic shoals
- **Kickapoo:** Lower energy fluvial/deltaic environment with high clay content

### Structural Considerations
- Well reportedly ran **9 feet structurally lower** than Deverick Heirs #1 Well to the west
- Regional dip toward the east affecting hydrocarbon migration

## Risk Assessment

### Completion Risks
- **Sand Production:** High risk in Aux Vases due to unconsolidated nature
- **Water Production:** Moderate risk, requires water saturation analysis
- **Formation Damage:** Risk during completion operations in tight zones

### Economic Considerations
- **Multiple pay zones** provide completion optionality
- **Shallow depth** reduces drilling/completion costs
- **Established field production** reduces geological risk

## Conclusions

1. **Primary Target:** Aux Vases Sandstone represents the best immediate completion opportunity with excellent reservoir quality and oil shows
2. **Deep Potential:** Ordovician carbonates (2850-3020') show significant potential with multiple oil shows and microfractured reservoir quality
3. **Unconventional Opportunity:** Devonian Sweetland Creek shales demonstrate gas potential requiring horizontal drilling and fracturing
4. **Well Success:** Multiple hydrocarbon-bearing intervals from shallow to deep indicate highly successful exploration
5. **Field Development:** Results strongly support continued development with multiple completion scenarios
6. **Completion Strategy:** Staged completion approach recommended - start with Aux Vases, then evaluate deep Ordovician potential
7. **Regional Significance:** Deep oil shows suggest untapped potential in Ordovician carbonates across the field
8. **Economic Viability:** Multiple pay zones provide operational flexibility and risk mitigation
9. **Formation Evaluation:** Detailed log analysis and possibly coring of deep intervals recommended for optimization
10. **Long-term Development:** Well demonstrates both conventional shallow targets and unconventional deep potential
