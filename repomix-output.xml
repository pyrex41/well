- **St. Genevieve:** Shallow marine carbonate shelf with oolitic shoals
- **Kickapoo:** Lower energy fluvial/deltaic environment with high clay content

### Structural Considerations
- Well reportedly ran **9 feet structurally lower** than Deverick Heirs #1 Well to the west
- Regional dip toward the east affecting hydrocarbon migration

## Risk Assessment

### Completion Risks
- **Sand Production:** High risk in Aux Vases due to unconsolidated nature
- **Water Production:** Moderate risk, requires water saturation analysis
- **Formation Damage:** Risk during completion operations in tight zones

### Economic Considerations
- **Multiple pay zones** provide completion optionality
- **Shallow depth** reduces drilling/completion costs
- **Established field production** reduces geological risk

## Conclusions

1. **Primary Target:** Aux Vases Sandstone represents the best immediate completion opportunity with excellent reservoir quality and oil shows
2. **Deep Potential:** Ordovician carbonates (2850-3020') show significant potential with multiple oil shows and microfractured reservoir quality
3. **Unconventional Opportunity:** Devonian Sweetland Creek shales demonstrate gas potential requiring horizontal drilling and fracturing
4. **Well Success:** Multiple hydrocarbon-bearing intervals from shallow to deep indicate highly successful exploration
5. **Field Development:** Results strongly support continued development with multiple completion scenarios
6. **Completion Strategy:** Staged completion approach recommended - start with Aux Vases, then evaluate deep Ordovician potential
7. **Regional Significance:** Deep oil shows suggest untapped potential in Ordovician carbonates across the field
8. **Economic Viability:** Multiple pay zones provide operational flexibility and risk mitigation
9. **Formation Evaluation:** Detailed log analysis and possibly coring of deep intervals recommended for optimization
10. **Long-term Development:** Well demonstrates both conventional shallow targets and unconventional deep potential

- **Multi-zone interference:** Pressure communication between zones
- **Water production:** Some zones show elevated Sw values
- **Formation damage:** Deep zones require careful completion practices
- **Stimulation requirements:** Fractured carbonates need appropriate treatment

### Economic Risks
- **Development costs:** Deep completions require higher investment
- **Production rates:** Fractured carbonates typically lower rate/longer lived
- **Market conditions:** Multiple pay flexibility provides risk mitigation

## Conclusions

1. **Outstanding Exploration Success:** 11 zones recommended for completion from 18 evaluated intervals

2. **Proven Productivity:** Multiple zones with documented offset production reduce geological risk

3. **Diverse Reservoir Portfolio:** Conventional sandstones, oolitic carbonates, and fractured limestone targets

4. **Deep Potential Discovery:** Trenton Limestone and Silurian Edgewood represent significant new play potential

5. **DST Validation:** Two drill stem tests confirm productivity in Devonian section

6. **Economic Viability:** Multiple completion scenarios provide operational flexibility

7. **Regional Significance:** Results support expanded field development and deeper exploration

8. **Completion Strategy:** Staged approach recommended - develop proven shallow zones first, then evaluate deep potential

9. **Technical Innovation Opportunity:** Deep fractured carbonates may benefit from modern completion techniques

10. **Field Development Driver:** This well demonstrates the Johnson South Field has significant additional potential across multiple formations and depth levels

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a well data repository containing oil and gas industry files for Murphy 1 well operations. The repository primarily stores:

- **LAS files** (.las): Log ASCII Standard format containing well log data
- **Mud logs** (PDF): Drilling progress and geological information
- **Well reports** (PDF): Comprehensive drilling and completion reports

## File Types and Formats

### LAS Files
- Industry standard format for well log data
- Contains header information and tabular log data
- Can be parsed using petroleum engineering libraries if needed

### PDF Documents
- Well reports and mud logs in PDF format
- May contain charts, graphs, and tabular data
- Often contain sensitive operational information

## Well Log Interpretation and Processing

This repository focuses on petrophysical analysis and well log interpretation. When processing well data:

### Lithology Identification
- **Gamma Ray (GR)**: High values indicate shale (clay-rich), low values suggest clean sandstone/carbonate
- **Spontaneous Potential (SP)**: Negative deflections indicate permeable sands, baseline suggests shales
- **Cross-plot Analysis**: Use neutron-density overlays for lithology determination:
  - Sandstone: Neutron and density porosities align closely
  - Shale: High neutron, lower density porosity
  - Limestone/Dolomite: Density porosity higher than neutron in dolomites
  - Gas effect: Low neutron, high density (light hydrocarbons)

### Key Calculations and Formulas
- **Shale Volume**: V_shale = (GR - GR_min) / (GR_max - GR_min) (Larionov equation)
- **Porosity from Density**: phi_D = (rho_matrix - rho_bulk) / (rho_matrix - rho_fluid)
- **Water Saturation**: S_w = (a * R_w / (phi^m * R_t))^(1/n) (Archie's equation)

### Rock Characteristics Analysis
- **Porosity**: Calculate from density and neutron logs, consider total vs. effective porosity
- **Permeability**: Infer from SP deflections combined with resistivity patterns
- **Fluid Saturation**: Integrate resistivity and porosity data
- **Formation Boundaries**: Identify using gamma ray and SP log responses

### Data Processing Approach
1. Parse LAS files for header information and log curve data
2. Apply quality control checks for data integrity
3. Calculate derived properties (shale volume, porosity, saturation)
4. Generate cross-plots for lithology identification
5. Create interpretation flags and zone classifications
6. Consider calibration with core data when available

### Working with This Repository

Since this is a data repository rather than a software project, typical development commands (build, test, lint) are not applicable. When working with these files:

1. **Petrophysical Analysis**: Focus on standard geophysical interpretations using established principles
2. **LAS File Processing**: Parse header and curve data, maintain format integrity
3. **Visualization**: Create plots for log curves, cross-plots, and derived properties
4. **Confidentiality**: Well data may contain proprietary or sensitive information

## Notes

This repository does not contain traditional software development files (package.json, source code, etc.). All operations should focus on data management and analysis rather than code development.

- **Strongest Gas:** Lower Partlow (167 units), Upper Partlow (140+ units)
- **Moderate Gas:** Grand Tower zones (50-75 units)
- **Light Gas:** Various shale intervals, Devonian section

## Regional and Structural Context

### Structural Position
- **9 feet structurally lower** than Deverick Heirs #1 Well (west)
- **Favorable position** for hydrocarbon accumulation on downdip side
- **Migration pathway** likely enhanced by structural position

### Field Development Status
- **Established Production:** Multiple zones with documented nearby production
- **Proven Reserves:** Several formations show "significant production" history
- **Development Confidence:** High success probability based on offset wells

## Completion Strategy Recommendations

### Phase 1: Conventional Multi-Zone Completion
**Target Zones:**
- Lower Partlow Sandstone (642-686')
- Upper Partlow Sandstone (552-580')  
- McClosky Limestone (888-896')
- Aux Vases Sandstone (758-776')

**Advantages:**
- Proven production history
- Conventional completion techniques
- Immediate cash flow generation
- Lower completion risk

### Phase 2: Deep Fractured Carbonate Development
**Target Zones:**
- Trenton Limestone (3135-3298')
- Silurian Edgewood (2842-2850')

**Requirements:**
- Hydraulic fracture stimulation
- Advanced completion design
- Higher investment but potentially larger reserves

### Phase 3: Devonian Unconventional Evaluation
**Target Zones:**
- Sweetland Creek Shales (gas shows)
- Additional Devonian intervals

**Approach:**
- Horizontal drilling consideration
- Multi-stage fracturing evaluation
- Long-term development potential

## Economic Assessment

### Development Economics
- **Multiple Pay Zones:** Provides operational flexibility and risk mitigation
- **Proven Production:** Reduces geological risk substantially  
- **Diverse Reservoir Types:** Enables various completion strategies
- **Staged Development:** Allows capital allocation optimization

### Investment Scenarios
1. **Conservative:** Complete proven shallow zones (~$200K investment)
2. **Moderate:** Add McClosky and Aux Vases (~$400K investment)
3. **Aggressive:** Include deep fractured carbonates (~$800K investment)

### Risk Mitigation Factors
- **11 potential pay zones** provide multiple success opportunities
- **Offset production** confirms geological concept
- **DST confirmation** validates log analysis
- **Professional validation** by experienced mudlogger

## Regional Development Impact

### Field Extension Implications
- **Deep potential** suggests significant undeveloped reserves
- **New play concepts** (Silurian Edgewood, deep Trenton)
- **Unconventional potential** in Devonian shales
- **Development drilling** targets identified for future wells

### Technology Applications
- **Modern completion techniques** could enhance deep zone productivity
- **Horizontal drilling** potential in shale intervals
- **Enhanced recovery** methods for mature conventional zones

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Multi-zone interference** - pressure communication management required
- **Formation damage** - careful completion practices essential for deep zones  
- **Water production** - some zones show elevated water saturations
- **Stimulation design** - deep carbonates require appropriate fracture treatments

### Economic Risks  
- **Development costs** increase with depth and completion complexity
- **Production profiles** vary significantly between conventional and fractured zones
- **Market access** and commodity price exposure

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Staged development** approach reduces initial capital exposure
- **Zone isolation** techniques prevent interference
- **Modern completion technology** maximizes recovery efficiency
- **Diversified target portfolio** provides multiple success paths

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-6 months)
1. **Complete detailed reservoir engineering** analysis of Tier 1 targets
2. **Design multi-zone completion** for Partlow sandstones and McClosky
3. **Secure drilling/completion contractor** with multi-zone experience
4. **Finalize surface facilities** design for multi-zone production

### Medium-term Planning (6-18 months)
1. **Monitor shallow zone performance** to validate reservoir models
2. **Plan deep zone evaluation** program (additional logging, coring)
3. **Assess regional development** opportunities based on Murphy #1 results
4. **Evaluate enhanced recovery** techniques for mature zones

### Long-term Strategy (1-3 years)
1. **Develop field-wide completion strategy** incorporating Murphy #1 learnings
2. **Evaluate unconventional potential** in Devonian shales
3. **Consider horizontal drilling** programs for optimal resource development
4. **Implement advanced reservoir management** techniques

## Conclusions

The W007 Murphy #1 well represents an **outstanding exploration success** that significantly enhances the Johnson South Field development potential. With **11 recommended completion zones** spanning multiple geological formations and **confirmed productivity through drill stem testing**, this well provides:

1. **Immediate Development Opportunity:** Four Tier 1 targets with proven offset production
2. **Significant Reserve Potential:** Deep fractured carbonates represent major undeveloped resources  
3. **Portfolio Diversification:** Multiple reservoir types provide operational flexibility
4. **Technology Application Potential:** Modern completion techniques could unlock additional reserves
5. **Regional Field Extension:** Results support expanded development across multiple formations
6. **Risk-Managed Investment:** Staged development approach balances risk and return
7. **Long-term Asset Value:** Multiple completion scenarios provide sustained production potential

**RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH IMMEDIATE COMPLETION PROGRAM** focusing on Tier 1 targets while planning comprehensive evaluation of deep zone potential.

Mudlogging Report for the ITB OIL, LLC MURPHY #1 Well
375N 330W SEc SW SW
Section 26, T09N, R14W
Clark County, Illinois
Depths Taken from K.B. @ 591'
Mudlogging was conducted from 12/3/2017 thru 12/10/2017. Samples were taken from 200' to 3344' T.D. depths. Each
sample was examined via a microscope and under a fluorescent lamp to detect any oil shows, and any odor was noted.
The following results came from mudlogging:
When compared to the Deverick Heirs #1 Well to the west, this well ran approximately 9 feet lower structurally on the
top of the Devonian Limestone. There were numerous shows of oil encountered in this well.
A show of oil was found in the shallow Kickapoo Sandstone at 200'-212' in a medium fine white quartz sandstone. There
was scattered fluorescence, and some fine oil droplets were released when crushing fluorescing pieces. There was no
appreciable gas spike here. This zone calculated Sws of .38 to .47, which is considered good for this type sand. Due to
the fairly good show of oil, this zone could be considered for production.
A show of oil was found in a shaley Penn. Sandstone at 502'-518' in a fine clear white quartz sandstone. There was up to
40% overall fluorescence, and some fine oil droplets were released when crushing fluorescing pieces. There was no
appreciable gas spike here. This zone calculated Sws of .33 to .47, which is considered good for this type sand. Due to
the fairly good show of oil, this zone could be considered for production.
A show of oil was found in the produced Upper Partlow Sandstone at 552'-580' in a medium to coarse grained clear white
quartz sandstone. There was up to 50% overall fluorescence, and some good oil was released when crushing fluorescing
pieces. There was a good gas spike of over 140 gas units here. This zone calculated Sws of .17 to .39, which is
considered very good for this type sand. This zone has been significantly produced in this area.
A show of oil was found in the much produced Lower Partlow Sandstone at 642'-686' in a clear quartz coarse well
rounded good porosity sandstone. There was up to 70% overall fluorescence, and some good free oil was released when
crushing fluorescing pieces. There was a good 167 gas units spike here. This zone calculated Sws of .30 to .51, which is
considered good for this type sand. This zone has been significantly produced in wells very close to this well.
A show of oil was found in what appears to be the Aux Vases Sandstone at 758'-776' in a medium fine amber stained
clear quartz sandstone. There was overall fluorescence of up to 25% with some good oil droplets released when crushing
fluorescing pieces. There was no appreciable gas spike here. This zone calculated Sws of .36 to .57, which is considered
good for this type sand. This zone was produced in some areas at some distance from this well. Due to the fairly good
show of oil, this sandstone should be considered for production.
A slight show of oil was found in the upper part of the Fredonia Limestone a small two foot thick zone at 788'-790' depth
in a light tan white oolitic limestone. There was up to 20% overall fluorescence, and almost no oil was released when
crushing fluorescing pieces. There was no appreciable gas spike here. This zone calculated Sws of .59 to .68, which is
considered not productive. This zone is not considered for production.
There was no show of oil found in the Rosiclare Sandstone at 838'-843' in a medium coarse clear good porosity quartz
sandstone. There was no fluorescence and no odor detected in this zone. However, porosities of up to 16% and
productive Sws values as low as of .31 were found in this zone. Because there were no shows of oil found in samples,
completion of this zone is not recommended.

## Page 2

A slight show of oil to show of oil was found in McClosky dolomitic limestone zone at 888'-896' in a tan fine sucrosic
dolomite rich oil saturated limestone with, in part, some tan white medium oolitic limestone with fluorescence. Samples
had very fine cuttings with good odor and were possibly washed out, leaving only scattered fluorescence. No appreciable
gas spike was found for this zone. Very good Sws of as low as .33, with porosities of up to 23%, were found here. This
zone is highly recommended for production.
A show of oil to show of oil was found in a rather thin Lower Carper Sandstone at 1765'-1770' in a light blue-green tinted
gray white very fine grained sandstone. This sandstone was quite firm and very calcareous, enough so that the PE curve
on the e-log seemed to be indicating almost a limestone. Samples had good odor and up to 60% overall fluorescence with
some pieces fading over time, but most yielded some oil when crushed. Data shows a gas spike of up to 25 gas units for
this zone, with calculated Sw values as low as .48 and porosities of up to 9 to 15%. A 64 minute drill stem test was
conducted through this zone from 1766' to 1793'. This resulted in ISIP 17#/63 MIN, recording 10' of mud with a show of
oil in tool. This zone is highly recommended for production.
There were several shows of oil found in the Devonian Limestone Section. A slight show of oil was found in the Lingle
Limestone at 1918' to 1925'. This was a dolomitic light tan limestone with some pieces having dolomite possibly lining
cavities and very scattered fluorescence with fluorescing pieces yielding little to no oil. This zone, because of the weak
show of oil, is not recommended for production.
A good show of oil was found at in the Grand Tower at 1938'-1944' in a tan white to white dolomitic limestone. This
zone had good odor and up to 80% overall fluorescence yielding good free oil droplets especially when crushing
fluorescing pieces. There appears to be some pieces with oil filling small cavities. Sws values for this zone were .59 to as
high as .65, with porosities as high as 14%. An 184 minute drill stem test was conducted through this zone from 1932' to
1956'. This resulted in ISIP 27#/121 MIN, FSIP 62#/182 MIN, with 15' of mud with a show of oil in tool and 75' of gas in
pipe. Because its free oil yielding and good show of oil, this zone is highly recommended for production, even though Sw
values seem to calculate somewhat wet. A nice gas spike of up to 50 gas units was found here.
Another show of oil was found in the Grand Tower Limestone at 1964'-1968' in a mostly chalky matrixed fine sucrosic
dolomite with good fluorescence and strong odor. Fluorescing pieces yield some oil. this zone had a good gas spike of 75
gas units. Sws values for this zone were .43 to as high as .53, with porosities as high as 9.5%. This zone is highly
recommended for production.
There was a show of oil in the Geneva Dolomite at 2028'-2042' in a light tan chalky fine sucrosic friable dolomite with
good odor and up to 20% overall fluorescence. Many very similar looking pieces do not fluoresce indicating possibly
some water associated with the zone. A moderate gas spike of 29 units came from this zone. Sws calculated to be from
.55 to around .65, with porosities as high as 12.5%. This zone could be considered for completion, however, careful
treatment should be utilized when attempting production from this zone. It is recommended that only a small portion of
the best calculated Sw footage be perforated, with minimal stimulation.
There was no show of oil found coming from the Dutch Creek Sandstone, however a very good looking, good porosity
medium fine to almost coarse grained clear quartz sandstone was found at 2084'-209' depths. This zone had crossplot
porosites as high as 18 %, and a good Sw value of .50 at the best porosity footage, indicating productivity. Applying
caution and care, this zone, could be considered for production.
An interesting and possibly good potential zone was found in the Silurian Edgewood Formation, with a slight show of oil
at 2842'-2850'. There was scattered fluorescence in an almost pure white friable fine grained limestone that seemed to
have microvugs. Crushing these fluorescing pieces yielded good abundant free oil drops. The 2850'-2860' sample had
good odor. Sws for this zone were very good and calculated to be as low as .38 and averaging in the .40s. Porosities were
also good with some being up to 14%. This zone is highly recommended for completion.
A slight show of oil was found in the Ft. Atkinson Limestone Section at 2966'-2969' in a coarsely crystalline
microfractured limestone with scattered pieces with blue green white fluorescence. There was no notable odor coming
from samples, but crushing fluorescing pieces did yield some oil. Sw values were not good, (.77 to over 1.0). Also,
porosity values were very low of only 2 to 3 %. This zone is not recommended for production.

## Page 3

There was another Ft. Atkinson Section very slight show of oil at around 3007' to 3020' area. Fluorescence was found in a
single piece or two of blue green tinted gray fine grainstone limestone. The sample had no odor. The fluorescing pieces
did yield some oil when crushed. Some Sw values were around .47 to as low as .38, with porosities of 7.8%. Because of
the slight show of oil, this zone is not recommended for production.
The Trenton Limestone had many shows of oil essentially starting just below the top of the formation at around 3135' to
the Platteville at 3298'. All shows were of a similar looking lithology, being a chalky white tan microfractured crystalline
to sublithographic limestone having white edges to fractures. Fluorescence seemed to progressively increase as it was
being drilled into the deeper parts of the formation, to as high as 20% overall fluorescence. Most porosity values were
low and around 3 to 4 to up to around 5.5%. Sw values using an Rw of .07, were as low as .45, and many averaging in the
.50s. This very thick zone is highly recommended for production.
